# Approach to the problem

### 1. Checking whether dices dots are inside the dices box.
        After classifying dices and dots by checking their area, the algorithm which detected if dots were inside dices contours was ran. This action filtered small rectangles outside of dices.

### 2. Counting average value ('middle') of all detected boxes.  

### 3. Averages of dices areas and dices dots areas.
        After the first step in soultion, dices and dices dots were classified by labelling areas of boxes as follows: if the area was greater than the 'middle' value, then it was a dice, else it was dices' dot. Then these values were used to classify dots and dices by changing values which distinguished objects.    

        Results for the 100_dices folder:
            Average area of dices dots:  81.31931317543793   
            Average area of dices:  1888.6862380952382   

### 4. Checking proportions of a bounding box.
        Then, still small boxes were present inside some dices. Also some areas of photos where there was a spotlight, were recognized as dices. Checking proportions of boxes was applied and it helped to filter unwanted objects even more.

### a.2) All dices except '3' were recognized correctly. Instead of recognizing '3' as a dice with six dots, algorithm counted three.

## b) Results when using 1 & 2 & 3 approach to the problem.
Using trial and error method, the 'middle' value which determined whether on the picture was dice or dot, was calculated.

area > 1000 -> kostka
area < 100 -> oczko
else -> none
